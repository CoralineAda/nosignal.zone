## Local development

To build the website locally, first [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)
using your package manager of choice.

For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
```
apt-get install hugo
```

or if you are using Arch Linux:
```
pacman -S hugo
```

or using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS:
```
brew install hugo
```

Then from the repository's root directory, start the development server:
```
hugo server -D
```
