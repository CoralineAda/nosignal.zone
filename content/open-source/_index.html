    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/ephemeral">Ephemeral</a></h4>
    <p>
      Ephemeral brings ORM-like functionality to non-persisted Ruby objects.
      The anticipated use case is for an application that consumes an
      API and materializes one or more collections of objects from a
      JSON response or XML response. Another frequent use involves
      providing relations and scopes to POROs (plain old Ruby objects).
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/society">Society</a></h4>
    <p>
      Society analyzes and presents a social graph of relationships between
      classes in a Ruby or Rails project. It shows both afferent and
      efferent coupling in a stunning visual graph. You can click on
      class names to filter the data and focus on couplings (inbound
      and outbound) related to a given class.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/poro_plus">PoroPlus</a></h4>
    <p>
      PoroPlus is a tiny Ruby gem that provides friendly methods intended
      to make POROs (Plain Old Ruby Objects) more useful, most
      notably by adding intelligent initializers that auto-map to
      defined attributes.

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/revenant">Revenant</a></h4>
    <p>
      (Work in progress!) Revenant is a gem that is designed to find
      dead code in Ruby applications. This is a difficult problem
      in a dynamic language, since static analysis of the abstract syntax
      tree (AST) is impossible. As a result the output of the
      gem will represent "best guesses" about methods that seem to be
      unused, which when combined with human investigation and
      instinct can inform a code cleanup effort.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/rspec_statsd">Rspec Statsd</a></h4>
    <p>
      Test run times can be a valuable measure of code quality and the
      overall health of your development efforts. Long test run
      times are a sign that TDD is getting more difficult (or ignored),
      and a test suite that is getting longer over time is a
      symptom of best testing practices multiplying and spreading.
      This custom Rspec formatters sends test execution times to
      a statsd server for tracking your test executions over time.

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/ambient_spec">Ambient Spec</a></h4>
    <p>
      Ambient Spec is a unique Rspec and Minitest formatter that
      turns your test output into soothing, atmospheric music.
      Sweet sounds come from passing examples, and gentle gongs signal
      failing tests. (Note that you won't hear anything unless your
      test suite run is longer than 5 seconds. Silence is the most
      pleasing sound of all.)

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/fukuzatsu">Fukuzatsu</a></h4>
    <p>
      Fukuzatsu ("complexity") is a tool for measuring code complexity
      in Ruby class files. Its analysis generates scores based on
      cyclomatic complexity algorithms, which in simplest terms measure
      the number of execution paths through a given piece of code.
      Fukuzatsu was created by Coraline Ada Ehmke with help from Mike
      Ziwisky. It is intended to be a replacement for popular tools
      that overstep the ABC algorithm and inject "opinionated" reasoning
      about code complexity. It was originally inspired by Saikuro,
      written by Zev Blut.

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/snuffle">Snuffle</a></h4>
    <p>
      Snuffle analyzes source code to identify "data clumps", clusters
      of attributes that are often used together. It uses this
      analysis to propose objects that may be extracted from a given
      class. It also looks for objects that are hinted at by method
      names and identifies them as "latent objects". For example,
      if you have home_address and work_address methods in a User
      class, Snuffle will tell you that you might want to extract
      those methods to a latent Address class. Snuffle is still
      pre-release and will not be ready for serious use until it
      hits version 1.0.0. Based on an idea developed with Kerri Miller (@kerrizor).

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CoralineAda/alice">Alice</a></h4>
    <p>
      Alice is a Slack bot with intelligence and personality. Most
      notable about the Alice project, aside from her natural
      language processing capabilities and built-in Zork-like game,
      is her functional-programming-inspired pipeline architecture.
      You can see see a diagram of this architecture in the project
      README.
