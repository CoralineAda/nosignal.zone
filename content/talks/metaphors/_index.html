<h3>Metaphors Are Similes. Similes Are Like Metaphors.</h3>
<h3>Coraline Ada Ehmke</h3>
<p>
  Language matters more than you think. And the more you think, the more you need language. This talk explores the connections between language and problem solving, how the metaphors that we use can expand or constrain our thinking, and how it all relates to our identities as software developers and as human beings. Along the way we'll learn about linguistics, category theory, Russian colors, gigantic bridges in France, and how to pronounce the word "lacuna". And you'll definitely have some things to think about. Hopefully, in new ways.
