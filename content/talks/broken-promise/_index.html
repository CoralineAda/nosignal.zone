<h3>The Broken Promise of Open Source</h3>
<h3>Coraline Ada Ehmke</h3>
<p>
  The open source movement has fallen far short of the idealism of
  its earliest proponents. What began as a utopian vision of programmers
  creating free software for free distribution in practice reflects
  the same significant cultural issues prevalent throughout the
  software industry: problems of unequal access and oppressive power
  structures enabling a privileged few to act as gatekeepers of
  access and arbiters of value. This talk explores the fundamental
  principles upon which open source was based and how each in turn
  has been subverted by the reality of human nature.
