<h3>How Graph Databases Saved My Relationship</h3>
<h3>Coraline Ada Ehmke</h3>
<p>
  Relational databases have come a long way in the past decade, but
  sometimes complex data models (a map of network infrastructure,
  or a quantum-entangled network of social relationships) call for
  a different approach. How can we address these sorts of modeling
  challenges? This talk will explore practical uses of Neo4J, a
  graph database designed to solve the problems of connections and
  relations that are too complex for traditional relational databases.
  We'll learn about managing and querying highly connected data
  and explore the power of graph databases in taming our complex
  data problems.
  The talk starts with a discussion of what graph databases are
  and the common problems that they solve. It focuses on several
  real-world use cases, including examples from network infrastructure,
  social media and artificial intelligence. It also covers specifics
  of using the Neo4j ORM in Ruby and Rails and explore fully populated
  data sets with complex relations to demonstrate the power and
  flexibility of graph databases for storage and querying.
