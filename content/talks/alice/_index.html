<h3>Alice's Adventures in AI-Land</h3>
<h3>Coraline Ada Ehmke</h3>
<p>
  Many programmers enjoy making useful chat bots that execute simple
  commands, enforce rules of a community, and even do deployments
  via chat-ops. But what if your bot could go beyond these capabilities
  and interact with people in conversation?
</p>
<p>
  Introducing Alice, a friendly, smart, and sometimes smart-ass
  companion that makes online communities more interactive and personable.
  Alice seems genuinely intelligent. She remembers facts about people
  (including pronouns, history, trivia, and bios), lets them play
  a text-based Zork-like dungeon game, and— most interestingly—
  comprehends simple English!
</p>
<p>
  She's also complex: built on a custom natural language processing
  (NLP) framework complete with grammar parsers to understand simple
  sentences, context stacks that track conversation topics, and a
  pipeline architecture inspired by functional programming. This
  talk includes an interactive demonstration of a unique approach
  to artificial intelligence that will inspire you to take your own
  bots beyond the realm of triggering animated gifs, providing
  practical and entertaining functionality with personality and charm.
