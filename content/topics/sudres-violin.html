  After wrapping up <a href="#a-little-fire-scarecrow">A Little Fire Scarecrow</a>
  in early 2021, I started a new solo project, Sudre's Violin, to reconcile
  the guitar-centered approach of my pre-transition music ("Dust and a Shadow")
  with the synth-centered music of 2016-2020.

  Following their 2022 debut is "The Nine Doors", a full-length album featuring 9 original songs. The wordless narrative of "The Nine Doors" unfolds through the dark instrumentation, hypnotic rhythms, broken synths, and haunted piano that is the signature sound of Sudre's Violin. The theme and feel of "The Nine Doors" is inspired by the modern literary classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=The%20Club%20Dumas">"The Club Dumas"</a> by Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte. Listen or pick up "The Nine Doors" on <a href="https://coralineada.bandcamp.com/album/the-nine-doors">Bandcamp</a>.

  In 2024, Sudre's Violin released "Seven Souls", a journey through 7 sonic landscapes haunted by broken synths, throaty guitars, eerie pianos, and hypnotic rhythms. You can listen for free on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/coralineada/sets/seven-souls">Soundcloud</a> or download the album on <a href="https://coralineada.bandcamp.com/album/seven-souls">Bandcamp</a>.

  The fourth and final release from Sudre's Violin, "Figure Six", was released on April 6th. Six new tracks explore new rhythmic territory while maintaining the dark, atmospheric, and literary mood that the project is known for.
