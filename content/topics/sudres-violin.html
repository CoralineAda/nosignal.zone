  After wrapping up <a href="#a-little-fire-scarecrow">A Little Fire Scarecrow</a>
  in early 2021, I started a new solo project, Sudre's Violin, to reconcile
  the guitar-centered approach of my pre-transition music ("Dust and a Shadow")
  with the synth-centered music of 2016-2020.

  Following this 2022 debut, "The Nine Doors" is a full-length album featuring 9 original songs. The wordless narrative of "The Nine Doors" unfolds through the dark instrumentation, hypnotic rhythms, broken synths, and haunted piano that is the signature sound of Sudre's Violin, The theme and feel of "The Nine Doors" is inspired by the modern literary classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=The%20Club%20Dumas">"The Club Dumas"</a> by Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte. (There's also an obligatory Nick Drake reference, of course.)
