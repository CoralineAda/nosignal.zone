<p>
  Based on the true story of how I got my first synth, which was a Roland Juno, and my first gig, which was an epic disaster.
</p>

<p>This week's <a href="https://disquiet.com/0725">Disquiet Junto prompt</a> asked us to imagine the sonic equivalent of "rack focus", a film camera technique in which focus shifts between the foreground and background of a long single shot. For example, there might be a close shot of our brave heroine with the indistinct blob of a highrise behind her, but then her face blurs and the background comes into focus, and we see a dark figure looking down at her from a high window across the street.

  Features the Moog Minitaur analog bass synthesizer, TR-08 drum machine, and the pièce de résistance, a Roland JU-06-- the tabletop boutique reissue of my selfsame old Juno synth!
