  <a href="https://disquiet.com/0718">Disquiet Junto 0718</a> asked us to imagine the audio our stealth drone recorded on a visit to the surface of the alien planet.

  This one was a lot of fun to put together! It gave me a great excuse to experiment with microtonal composition, and learn how to configure custom tunings in Logic. I chose the Maqam scale, a traditional scale in Arabic music believed to have originated in ancient Egypt. The main melodic line is typical for the scale, arcing from root to octave and then descending again. The percussion was inspired by reading about Wahda w-Nuss rhythms.</p>
