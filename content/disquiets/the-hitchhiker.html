  In honor of David Lynch's passing, I made a dramatic short story in sound, doing my best to make "Walkin' After Midnight" into something creepy. I wanted to avoid the trope of a woman being followed late at night, and instead went with the trope of the hitchhiker who may not be all that she seems to be. I spent a lot of time on stereo orchestration so please use headphones when listening.
