  <a href="https://disquiet.com/0721">Disquiet Junto 0721</a> invited us to provide musical accompaniment to a storm.

  This one made me think of my grandmother. She and I would sit in her glassed-in porch and drink tea while the storms of the Atlantic coastal summer raged outside, wind throwing sheets of rain against the windows, the sky purple with flashes of white, the thunder making the ground shake. She helped me understand the difference between awe and fear.

  Features vintage Korg M3R and a field recording I made of a Chicago storm back in July.
