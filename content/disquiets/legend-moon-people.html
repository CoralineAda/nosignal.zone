  <a href="https://disquiet.com/0719">Disquiet Junto 0719</a> had us dueling with a metronome, challenged to record a piece of music that weaves in and out of beat.
</p>

<p>
  I recorded the lead performance on my old favorite, the monophonic Moog Minitaur. Since this synth doesn't sync to the MIDI clock on the computer, riding the LFO controls manually let me improvise the swirling/cycling/beating patterns that dance within, against, and without the beat, satisfying the prompt.
</p>

<p>In addition to the Minitaur, the track features the Roland JU-06 and Waldorf Streichfett string synth.
