<p>
  In thinking about my response to this week's <a href="https://disquiet.com/0728">Disquiet Junto prompt</a>, which asked us to write a melody that drops one of its notes on each repetition, I imagined that the song was slowly losing its memory with each retellingå.

  This was the first time I recorded my new Modal Electronics Argon8M wavetable synth.  The lead synth line on the Argon is doubled with a software synth with heavy tape delay, which you can hear isolated and distant in the outro once the main lead has lost all of its notes. The drone tone gets a little low-end boost from arpeggiated bursts played on the Moog Minitaur analog bass synth. A combination of electronic drum machine and synthetic acoustic drums provide the frantic beat to round things out.
