<p>
  Throughout my 30s, my music came from a place of sorrow. After I
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPy1vGedYI0">transitioned in 2014</a>,
  I was sure that I would never make music again. Because that creative center,
  that sorrow I had drawn on for so long, was no longer with me.
</p>
<p>
  But from the day in 2016 that an idea for a drum pattern haunted me and tricked me
  into opening Logic again, to the day in 2020 that I decided that I was ready to
  explore new directions, I released 8 albums. One of my songs was even featured
  on an official Spotify playlist for
  <a href="https://translifeline.org">Trans Day of Visibility</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Out of those 65 songs, these are the 8 that best tell the story of that era of my musical journey. Grab a copy of <a href="https://coralineada.bandcamp.com/album/not-the-worst-of-a-little-fire-scarecrow">"(Not the Worst of) A Little Fire Scarecrow"</a> for free or pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp.
