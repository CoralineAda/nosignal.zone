<p>
  13 months in the making, "Five Lies Left" is the first release from my Sudre's Violin solo project. It's been (kindly) described as dreadful, dread-full, and highly experiential.
</p>

<p>This project brought me back to a more performance-based approach to recording. The guitar is live, the bass is live, and the synth and piano parts were mostly improvised and minimally edited. (In contrast, most of the sparse vocals are of unnatural origin.)

  It's available for free/pay-what-you-want on <a href="https://coralineada.bandcamp.com/album/five-lies-left">Bandcamp</a> and will be available on all major streaming services soon.
