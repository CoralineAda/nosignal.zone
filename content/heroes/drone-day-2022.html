<p>
  For the second year in a row, on 2022-05-09 I took part in <a href="https://droneday.org">Drone Day</a>,
  a 24-hour, global celebration of drone & experimental music.
</p>
<p>
  This year's piece is called "The Goth", featuring samples from the Gay Byrne interview with 19-year-old goth Siobhan. You can <a href="https://soundcloud.com/coralineada/the-goth-session-3?in=coralineada/sets/irish-tv">listen to the WIP on soundcloud</a>.</p>
</p>
<p>
  This is part of a 5-year project tentatively called "Irish TV", featuring a series of 5 monotonic compositions inspired by a 1983 Irish TV talk show. Every successive Drone Day, I will live-stream while I compose, record, and produce a new song in the series.

  The complete <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g9UAFXCrSQ&t=7s">Drone Day 2022 live session</a> is available on YouTube.
