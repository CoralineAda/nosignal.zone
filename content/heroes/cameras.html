  Watch the official video for the first Calamity Orchestra single,
  "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=891AQ-7oGOk&t=1s">Cameras</a>".
  The song is a reflection on how the world viewed the anti-racist and
  anti-fascist protests in 2020, mediated by cameras-- cell, body, media.

  The video for our second single, "All You Fascists (Fuck Off)", should be
  ready sometime in August. In the mean time, you can <a href="https://calamityorchestra.bandcamp.com">download both singles
  on Bandcamp</a>.
