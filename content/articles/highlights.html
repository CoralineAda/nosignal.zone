      Doing some guitar for the shoegaze-y Leonard Cohen cover. Finally got that
      bloody G#min "heartbreak" chord in the right place, and pretty happy with
      the My Bloody Valentine-style bends.

      Never mind the overblown bass, we've got a good atmosphere going here. Oh,
      and this is the first song I'm doing for my new solo project.

    <p>
      Working the knobs on a <a href="https://www.makenoisemusic.com/synthesizers/ohcoast">0-COAST modular synthesizer</a>.
        The name is a reference to both the Moog ("East Coast") and Buchla ("West Coast") paradigms,
        which this synth reconciles.
