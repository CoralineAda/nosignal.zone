  This is a living room recording (one mic, in the middle of the room) of my old band from Austin, Uncle Karma, jamming and improvising with some friend-of-a-friend horn players. We only have the vaguest memory of this happening. It was recorded in Austin, Texas on August 4, 1993.

  My friend, former bandmate, and most recently <a href="http://auntiekismet.bandcamp.com">Auntie Kismet collaborator</a> rescued five selections from the session from on an old cassette tape he found.
