<p>
  May 25, 2024 made year 4 of my 5-year "Gangs of Ireland" project. Starting in 2021, each year on Drone Day (<a href="https://droneday.org">droneday.org</a>) I've created a new experimental piece inspired by a segment from an 80s-era Irish talk show featuring young goths, punks, & mods. This year was "The Mod".
</p>

<p>
  The performance was live-streamed, and you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y32VCMD9Kaw&t=2367s">concert video</a> from the livestream broadcast from NO SIGNAL Multimedia Labs.
