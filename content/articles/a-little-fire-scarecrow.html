    <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.com/releases/sublimation/">Sublimation</a> (2019)
    <p>
       A very personal album the explores my relationship with
       mental health challenges, including Bipolar Disorder, suicidal ideation,
       dissociation, and anxiety.
       <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/track/lacunescent-dissociation">Lacunescent</a>
       is one of my favorite tracks on this album, inspired by a word I made up
       in a dream.

       Songs and soundscapes drawn from my own dreams and nightmares. I'm particularly
       proud of <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/track/a-shape-amongst-the-stones">
       A Shape Amongst the Stones</a> and
        <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/track/if-only-today-we-could-wake">If Only Tonight We Could Wake</a>,
        which I wrote as a sequel to one of my favorite Cure songs.

      <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/track/tower">Tower</a>, a
      one-chord instrumental inspired by Swans. This song comes from
      <a href="https://alittlefirescarecrow.bandcamp.com/album/arcana-unfinished">Arcana</a>,
      an unfinished 2020 concept album based on the Tarot. I absolutely love the
      slow build.
