<p>
	My latest album, "Source (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)", is now available! Inspired by the myth of Eurydice and Orpheus and the wisdom of Rick Rubin, "Source" is the soundtrack to a fateful journey through a dream-like Underworld in search of a doomed love.
</p>

<p>
	The 8 tracks on this album represent a departure from the post-punk sensibilities of my earlier work. Using a wide variety of vintage, analog, and modular synthesizers, "Source" is as much an exploration of the Underworld as it is a recontextualization of vintage sounds in a non-nostalgic, contemporary context.
</p>

<p>
	"Source" is available on <a href="https://coralineada.bandcamp.com/album/source-original-motion-picture-soundtrack">Bandcamp</a>, or free and federated on <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/68b88dd42b10f9e2cb960889">bandwagon.fm</a>.
