<p>
  A response to <a href="https://disquiet.com/2024/01/25/disquiet-junto-project-0630-creative-sufficiency/">Disquiet Junto 0630: Creative Sufficiency</a>, a challenge to choose, in advance, a limit on the number of pieces of equipment, instruments, software, or plugins that will be used in the piece.
</p>

<p>
  I chose 9 components: Logic, keyboard controller, piano, bass, drum kit, 8th triplet stereo delay, 8th stereo delay, room reverb, and a StepFX plugin. The polyrhythms are the result of automating the send amounts to the auxiliary channels with the competing stereo delays.
</p>

<p>
  I wanted the overall feel to be a film noir carnival chase scene played on a Korg M1.
