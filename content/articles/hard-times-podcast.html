<p>
  I got my <em>very first music review</em> on 2021-12-14, on the
  <a href="https://fanboys.libsyn.com/the-industrial-episode">Hard Times 'Fanboys' Podcast</a>!
  Starting around the 27:23 mark, they talk about "The Punk", my experimental Drone Day piece.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"It made me feel a way that drone music never has, that was really really cool"</li>
  <li>"It could be in the soundtrack for Prometheus"</li>
  <li>"It's creepy, it's haunted, but also a little bit uplifting. You feel wonder."</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I can't thank <a href="https://thehardtimes.net">The Hard Times</a> enough for the
  kind words and constructive feedback. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/coralineada/the-punk-session-2-6-11-21?in=coralineada/sets/gangs-of-ireland">Listen to the song "The Punk" on Soundcloud</a>.
