<p>
  My first contribution to <a href="https://disquiet.com/2023/11/30/disquieâ€¦2-know-the-shadow/">Disquiet Junto</a>, responding to the prompt "Know the Shadow".
</p>
<!--p>
  With the reference to "The Shadow Knows" in the prompt, I had the idea to recreate an old radio program. I dug around in the Internet Archive and found recordings of 1930s radio from which I cut samples. Select samples were then arranged to tell the story I wanted to tell, of a mentalist named Professor Penumbra hypnotizing the listener through the radio.
</p-->
<p>
  The concept of a shadow is expressed in multiple ways: in the title, within the samples, with stereo imaging, with polyrhythms, and using high- and low-frequency EQ sweeps.
</p>
<p>
  To fully experience the shadow, please enjoy with headphones.
