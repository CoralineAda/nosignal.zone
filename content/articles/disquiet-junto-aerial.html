<p>
  <a href="https://disquiet.com/2024/01/11/disquiet-junto-project-0628-alchemical-brothers/">Disquiet Junto 0628: Alchemical Brothers</a> asked us to contemplate the alchemical process of separation, and its related element of air.
</p>

<p>
  As with fire, water, and earth, the alchemical symbol for air is a triangleâ€” in its case, pointing upward and bisected by a horizon line. This composition is made from triangles, expressed through tritones, rising thirds, triplets, and meter. My daughter called it "structural creativity".
</p>

<p>
  The vocals were created with AI-enhanced text-to-speech, using content adapted from "The Visions of Zosimos".
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: Some triangles require headphones to detect. You do not want to leave triangles undetected. Triangles are the most dangerous of shapes.
