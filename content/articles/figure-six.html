<p>
	"Figure Six" is the fourth release from the mysterious postpunk ensemble Sudre's Violin, and according to sources is likely to be their last for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
	The six songs on the album feature the usual lineup of heavy percussion, luscious bass, lonesome guitar, and sinister piano that the band is known for. In an interesting bit of trivia, the final track on the song was inspired by a <a href="https://disquiet.com/0664" target="blank">Disquiet Junto prompt</a> and is in the bizarre time signature of 29/16.
