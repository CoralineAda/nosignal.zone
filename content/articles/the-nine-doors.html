<p>
  "The Nine Doors" will be the second release and first full-length album from Sudre's Violin, my latest solo recording project. The theme of the project is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=The%20Club%20Dumas">"The Club Dumas"</a> by Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte. (There's also an obligatory Nick Drake reference.)
