<p>
  Following 2022's debut "Five Lies Left" EP, this new release, "The Nine Doors" is a full-length album featuring 9 original songs. The wordless narrative of "The Nine Doors" unfolds through the dark instrumentation, hypnotic rhythms, broken synths, and haunted piano that is the signature sound of Sudre's Violin.

<p>
  The theme and feel of "The Nine Doors" is inspired by the modern literary classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?search=The%20Club%20Dumas">"The Club Dumas"</a> by Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte. (There's also an obligatory Nick Drake reference, of course.)
