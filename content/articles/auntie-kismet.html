<p>
  A collaboration with composer and experimental musician
  <a href="http://www.errant.space">Craig Chin</a>.   We worked asynchronously, taking turns adding or removing layers to compose these pieces.

<p>
  The name is a reference to the band we were in together in the 90s, Uncle Karma. We had a manifesto. Like I said, it was the 90s.
