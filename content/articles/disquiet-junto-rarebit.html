<p>This week's Disquiet Junto prompt was "<a href="https://disquiet.com/0631/">0631: In a Silent Waveform</a>". The instructions were to "take one held tone and make it dance slowly".

<p>
  The title of my piece, "Dream of a Rarebit Fiend," is taken from a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dream_of_a_Rarebit_Fiend_(Edwin_Stanton_Porter).webm">1906 silent film</a> about a man who gorges himself on Welsh rarebit and falls into fever dreams of pesky imps and a night flight above the rooftops. 
</p>

<p>
  I chose 554.37 Hz as my single source tone, and recorded 8 tracks of it: 5 on guitar with ebow, and 3 on a Roland/Studio Electronics SE-02 analog synth. These tracks were then woven together and processed with a variety of rhythm-based effects to create the motion of dancing. Underneath it all is a single an unsettling kick drum. The rhythm is everywhere and nowhere, something and nothing, like a fever dream.

<p>
  NOTE: Your odds of discovering a secret recipe for Welsh rarebit hidden in the audio file may be improved by listening with headphones.
