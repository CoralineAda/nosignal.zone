  For this week's prompt, <a href="https://disquiet.com/0631/">Disquiet Junto 0631: In a Silent Waveform</a> invited us to simply "take one held tone and make it dance slowly".
</p>

<p>
  The title of my piece, "Dream of a Rarebit Fiend," is taken from a 1906 silent film directed by Edwin Porter. The film is seven minutes long, and is notable for its revolutionary special effects. It tells the story of a man who, upon gorging himself on Welsh rarebit (toasted cheese on bread), falls into bed with fever dreams of flying furniture, pesky imps, and a night flight above the rooftops. You can watch a restored version on Wikimedia Commons: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dream_of_a_Rarebit_Fiend_(Edwin_Stanton_Porter).webm">Dream_of_a_Rarebit_Fiend.webm</a>

  I chose Câ™¯-2 as my single tone, and recorded 6 tracks of it: 3 on my St Vincent Music Man guitar played with ebow, and 3 on a Roland/Studio Electronics SE-02 analog synth. These tracks were then woven together and processed with a variety of rhythm-based effects to create the motion of dancing. Underneath it all is a single an unsettling kick drum. The rhythm is everywhere and nowhere, something and nothing, like a fever dream.

  NOTE: Your odds of discovering a secret recipe for Welsh rarebit hidden in the audio file may be improved by listening with headphones.
