<p>
  <a href="https://disquiet.com/0633/">Disquiet Junto 0633, "Voice Swap"</a>, suggested recreating an existing piece using my voice. The easiest way to do this, of course, was to travel back in time and become my own producer. 
</p>

<p>
  The original piece, "(It Begins With) Unrest", opened the <a href="https://coralineada.bandcamp.com/album/not-the-worst-of-a-little-fire-scarecrow">last album by A Little Fire Scarecrow</a> and also opened my <a href="https://twitch.tv/CoralineAda">weekly studio stream on twitch</a> during the plague years.
</p>

<p>
  BE ADVISED: You haven't heard a backward drum hit until you've heard it with headphones on.
