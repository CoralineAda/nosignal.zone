<p>
	I met Randall met via Chicago DJ Jeff Moyer's twitch.tv stream and we decided to collaborate on an EP. We worked together remotely and asynchronously blending my more experimental approach with Randall's happy synthpop roots. A mix of synthesizers, guitars and deep layers of sonic texture.

	The title track features samples from the speech that Lana Wachowski gave when she was awarded the HRC Visibility Award in 2013. That speech saved my life.
