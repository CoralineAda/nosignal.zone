<p>
  <a href="https://disquiet.com/0664">Disquiet Junto 0664: Mother Beat</a> invited us to compose a piece in 29/16 time. I have never done so much math to make a song. I hope I got it right.
</p>

<p>
  I subdivided the 29 16th notes into measures of 3/ and 5/16. I started with percussion this time, and spent a lot of time programming and visually manipulating the beat mappings until I found something that didnâ€™t feel gimmicky. I created 3 variations to make a loop of a four-part drum progression.
</p>

<p>
  The top screaming synth follows the rhythm precisely but blurs the lines at that 5/16 transition. I think it wraps around the beat nicely.
</p>

<p>
  I was daunted at first but I learned a ton composing this piece, and ended up having a lot of fun.
