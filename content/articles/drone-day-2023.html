<p>
  2023 marked the 3rd year of my 5-year "Gangs of Ireland" project. Starting in 2021, each year on Drone Day (<a href="https://droneday.org">droneday.org</a>) I've created a new experimental piece inspired by a segment from an 80s-era Irish talk show featuring young goths, punks, & mods. This year's piece is "The Iconoclast".

  Check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y-tQcM64eo">Drone Day 2023 performance video</a> from a live performance at an experimental music event in Hudson Valley, New York.
