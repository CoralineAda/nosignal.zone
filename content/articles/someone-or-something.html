<p>
  _Songs for Girls (The Singles)_ is a catch-all for miscellaneous work that's not part of a specific project. Like this piece, a work-in-progress that I originally started to just practice drum programming.

  I'm pretty fond of the guitar part, especially the solo that comes in just after the 2:00 mark.
