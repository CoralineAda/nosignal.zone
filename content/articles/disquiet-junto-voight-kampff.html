  <a href="https://disquiet.com/0649">Disquiet Junto 0649</a> had me consider the form of the concerto: its constraints, its traditions; and to create our own composition based on these traits. I read up, listened, read some more, and made my list of rules and constraints. Then I set to it.

<p>
  The solo instrument is an ARP2600 that I sampled in the Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio (MESS) a couple of years ago. I improvised some chord movement with a generic pad and got the thin, flute-like ARP lead kind of dancing around on it in a single take. The overall feel reminded me of "Deckard's Blues" from the Blade Runner soundtrack, so I ran with that. The entire composition is 4 tracks of analog synths and an illegal quantity of reverb.

  Listen to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/coralineada/the-voight-kampff-concerto-disquiet0649">"The Voight-Kampff Concerto" by Coraline Ada Ehmke on Soundcloud</a> wearing good headphones, like the ones you got at that little shop under the glittering c-beams near the Tannhauser Gate.
