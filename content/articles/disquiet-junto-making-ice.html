  My response to the latest <a href="https://disquiet.com/2024/01/04/disquiet-junto-project-0627-just-ice-society/">Disquiet Junto</a> prompt, "0627 - Just Ice Society", calling for a piece built around the sound of ice in a glass.

  The vocals were created by AI-enhanced text-to-speech, with a script adapted from a WikiHow article. The track was recorded and produced at NOSIGNAL Multimedia Labs, The Shambles, Chicago, IL USA.

  Headphones are recommended, and please remember to use your allocated break time to make connections with others in your work unit.
