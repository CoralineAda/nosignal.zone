<p>
  May 24, 2025 was the final segment of my 5-year "Gangs of Ireland" project. Starting in 2021, each year on Drone Day (<a href="https://droneday.org">droneday.org</a>) I've created a new experimental piece inspired by a segment from an 80s-era Irish talk show featuring young goths, punks, & mods. This year wrapped the series revisiting each of the young people and paying musical tribute.

  The performance was recorded live at a Drone Day festival in Marlboro, New York.
