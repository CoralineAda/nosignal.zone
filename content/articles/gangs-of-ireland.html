<p>
  "Gangs of Ireland" is an experimental project inspired by a 1983 Irish television talk show featuring interviews with young people from goth, mod, and punk subcultures. Starting in 2021, every year on <a href="https://droneday.org">Drone Day</a> I will create and perform a new piece for the five-song EP.
