  The prompt for <a href="disquiet.com/0632/">Disquiet Junto 0632, "Shear Wind"</a>, instructed us to take that awful wind-blowing-across-the-microphone sound and make it useful.

</p>

<p>
  I live in a notoriously wind-swept city and the weather was cooperative, so I recorded several minutes of wind shear in my back yard with a stereo field recorder. I brought the recording into my DAW on three tracks, one reversed, and executed some glitch maneuvers to make them rhythmic. On top of everything is a Cmaj7 drone using a few layers of custom sampler instruments.

  REMEMBER: Headphones are antennae, like an insect's, that pick up the thoughts of the composer.

  Listen to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/coralineada/a-picnic-on-a-cliff-disquiet0632">"A Picnic on a Cliff" by Coraline Ada Ehmke on Soundcloud</a>, and feel just how far it would be to fall.
