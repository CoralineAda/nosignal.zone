      In a world of asynchronous communication, it’s more important than ever to create inclusive and remote-friendly

      <h4>The Social Responsibility of Software Engineers: Part 3, From Open Source to Ethical Source</h4>

    <time>Octoboer 23, 2020</time>
    <p>
      The insistence that software under an ethical license ‘isn’t open source’, 
      stood in stark contrast to the growing sense of unease in the community. 
      If ethical open source wasn’t truly open source, why couldn’t it be? 
      And why shouldn’t open source aspire to prioritize social good over 'evil' uses?

      As contributors and maintainers see their work being leveraged to commit human rights abuses 
      at an alarming scale, they’re starting to become aware of the significant impact of the 
      technologies they create on the broader world.

    <p>
      There is widespread apathy toward our ethical responsibilities as software developers, and it's is nowhere reflected so 
      dramatically as in the practice of open source. Is there something fundamental about open source that encourages us to 
      ignore the consequences of our work?

      The open source community has a strong desire to evolve, and if necessary, to redefine itself, to ensure that it can address the magnitude and complexity of today’s social, political and technological challenges.

      Emotions can be defined as “neurological programs that require action.” This metaphor may resonate with us as programmers and provide a foundation for developing critical skills in identifying and positively expressing a rich range of emotions in healthy response to our interactions with other people in our lives.
